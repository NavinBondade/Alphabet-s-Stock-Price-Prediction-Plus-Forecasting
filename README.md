Alphabet Inc. is an American multinational conglomerate. It was created through a restructuring of Google in 2015, and became the parent company of Google and several former Google subsidiaries. In 2020, Alphabet became the fourth US company to reach a $1 trillion market value. It is a publicly listed company on NASDAQ as GOOG.

Alphabet is one of the most profitable companies, and the investors have ripped a lot of money from it by investing in its share. Stock price prediction is a trick and cumbersome task, that's why I have created a deep learning model that has extensively trained on Alphabet's stock price data to predict the stock value and <b>give forcasting of next 60 days with an R2 score of 0.97.</b>
